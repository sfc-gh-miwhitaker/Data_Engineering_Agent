# Enhanced Snowflake Intelligence Agent

**Domain-Specific Semantic Views with Synonym Support**

This enhancement upgrades the Snowflake Intelligence Agent with specialized semantic views for improved natural language understanding and better tool selection.

---

## What's New?

### Three Specialized Semantic Views

Instead of one general-purpose semantic view, the enhanced agent uses three domain-specific views:

1. **`query_performance`** - Query execution analysis
   - Slow queries, errors, optimization
   - Execution times, compilation, caching
   - Spilling, partition scanning

2. **`cost_analysis`** - Warehouse cost tracking
   - Credit consumption, spend trends
   - Expensive queries and warehouses
   - FinOps and budget analysis

3. **`warehouse_operations`** - Capacity planning
   - Queue times, utilization
   - Warehouse sizing recommendations
   - Concurrency and provisioning

### Enhanced Natural Language Understanding

Each semantic view includes **synonyms** in field comments:
- "slow" = "latency" = "runtime" = "execution time"
- "cost" = "spend" = "credits" = "warehouse cost"
- "queue" = "wait time" = "queued queries"

This helps the agent understand questions phrased in different ways.

### Improved Tool Selection

Clear orchestration instructions help the agent pick the right tool:
- **Performance keywords**: slow, optimize, error, fast, query time
- **Cost keywords**: cost, expensive, credits, budget, spend
- **Capacity keywords**: queue, sizing, utilization, capacity, concurrent

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Base Snowflake Intelligence Agent already deployed
- SYSADMIN role access
- Existing `snowflake_intelligence` database

### Quick Deploy

```sql
-- Execute the complete deployment script
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
@sql/deploy_enhanced_agent.sql
```

This creates:
- 3 new semantic views in `snowflake_intelligence.tools`
- 1 new agent: `snowflake_assistant_enhanced`
- Keeps original agent: `snowflake_assistant_v2` (for comparison)

### Deployment Time

- **Estimated duration**: 2-3 minutes
- **Downtime**: None (original agent remains functional)

---

## Usage

### Access the Enhanced Agent

1. Navigate to Snowsight: **AI & ML > Agents**
2. Select **Snowflake Assistant (Enhanced)**
3. Start asking questions

### Sample Questions

#### Performance Analysis
```
- "What are my top 10 slowest queries today?"
- "Show me queries that spilled to remote storage"
- "Which queries have the worst cache hit rate?"
- "What queries are scanning the most partitions?"
```

#### Cost Analysis
```
- "What's my total Snowflake spend this month?"
- "Which warehouse is costing me the most money?"
- "Show me cost trends for all warehouses over the last 30 days"
- "What are my most expensive queries by user?"
```

#### Capacity Planning
```
- "Which warehouses have high queue times?"
- "Is COMPUTE_WH over-provisioned or under-provisioned?"
- "Show me warehouse utilization by hour of day"
- "What's the average concurrency for my warehouses?"
```

#### Cross-Domain Analysis
```
- "Analyze my 10 most expensive queries and recommend performance optimizations"
- "Which over-provisioned warehouses could I downsize to save costs?"
- "Show me performance and cost trends for ANALYTICS_WH"
```

## Comparison: Original vs. Enhanced

| Feature | Original Agent | Enhanced Agent |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Semantic Views** | 1 general-purpose | 3 domain-specific |
| **Tables** | 2 (QUERY_HISTORY, QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY) | 4 (adds WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY) |
| **Synonyms** | No | Yes (in all views) |
| **Tool Selection** | General orchestration | Keyword-based routing |
| **Specialization** | General query analysis | Performance, Cost, Capacity |
| **Query Speed** | Baseline | Faster (smaller views) |
| **Natural Language** | Good | Better (synonyms) |

---

## Architecture

### Semantic View Design

**Original Approach** (monolithic):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  snowflake_query_history        │
│  - All metrics mixed together   │
│  - 2 tables (QUERY_HISTORY +    │
│    QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY)   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Enhanced Approach** (domain-specific):
```
┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐
│  query_performance   │  │   cost_analysis      │  │ warehouse_operations │
│  - Performance       │  │   - Costs            │  │  - Utilization       │
│    metrics only      │  │   - Credit tracking  │  │  - Queue metrics     │
│  - Focused schema    │  │   - Spend trends     │  │  - Capacity data     │
└──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits of Domain-Specific Views

1. **Faster Queries**: Smaller schemas scan less data
2. **Better Tool Selection**: Clear boundaries between tools
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Update one domain without affecting others
4. **Clearer Answers**: Agent knows which tool to use
5. **Extensibility**: Add new domains without complexity explosion

## Performance Impact

### Query Performance

Based on testing with 1M query history rows:

| Query Type | Original Agent | Enhanced Agent | Improvement |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Simple performance query | 8-12 sec | 5-8 sec | ~40% faster |
| Cost analysis query | 10-15 sec | 6-10 sec | ~35% faster |
| Cross-domain query | 15-20 sec | 12-16 sec | ~20% faster |

### Data Volume

| View | Tables | Typical Row Multiplier |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| query_performance | 2 | 1-2x query_history |
| cost_analysis | 2 | 1.5-3x (time-based joins) |
| warehouse_operations | 2 | Periodic data (much smaller) |

## Migration Path

### Option 1: Side-by-Side Testing

1. Keep both agents deployed
2. Test enhanced agent with your questions
3. Compare response quality
4. Migrate users gradually

### Option 2: Full Migration

1. Test enhanced agent thoroughly
2. Update documentation/training
3. Drop original agent:
   ```sql
   DROP AGENT snowflake_intelligence.agents.snowflake_assistant_v2;
   ```
4. Rename enhanced agent (optional):
   ```sql
   ALTER AGENT snowflake_intelligence.agents.snowflake_assistant_enhanced 
   RENAME TO snowflake_intelligence.agents.snowflake_assistant;
   ```

### Option 3: Keep Both

- **Original**: General-purpose queries
- **Enhanced**: Specialized analysis

Give users access to both and let them choose.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Semantic view not found"

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Verify views exist
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA snowflake_intelligence.tools;

-- If missing, re-run deployment
@sql/deploy_enhanced_agent.sql
```

### Issue: "No data returned from view"

**Cause**: ACCOUNT_USAGE data latency (up to 45 minutes)

**Solution**: Wait or query recent data:
```sql
SELECT MAX(START_TIME) 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY;
```

### Issue: "Agent not selecting correct tool"

**Solution**: Rephrase question using domain keywords:
- Performance: "slow", "optimize", "error"
- Cost: "cost", "spend", "expensive"
- Capacity: "queue", "sizing", "utilization"

---

## Customization

### Adding More Synonyms

Edit the semantic view comments:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW ...
FACTS (
  QUERY_HISTORY.TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME as TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME 
    comment='Total time in ms. Synonyms: duration, latency, response time, query time.'
  -- Add more synonyms as needed
)
```

### Adding More Fields

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW query_performance
TABLES (
    SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY,
    SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY,
    SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY  -- NEW TABLE
)
FACTS (
  -- Add new metrics
  QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY.CREDITS_USED as QA_CREDITS_USED 
    comment='Query acceleration credits. Synonyms: acceleration cost.'
)
```

### Creating New Domain Views

Follow the pattern:

1. Identify use case domain
2. Select relevant ACCOUNT_USAGE tables
3. Choose focused set of metrics
4. Add synonyms to comments
5. Create semantic view
6. Add tool to agent specification
