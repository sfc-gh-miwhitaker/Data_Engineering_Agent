# Release Notes - v2.1

**Release Date**: October 17, 2025

**Status**: Ready for Production

---

## Overview

Version 2.1 significantly enhances the Snowflake Intelligence Agent project with comprehensive documentation for community deployment, safe teardown procedures, and an optional enhanced agent with domain-specific semantic views.

---

## What's New

### ðŸ“š Essential Documentation (2,625 lines)

#### 1. `.gitignore` (153 lines)
Comprehensive git ignore rules to protect sensitive data:
- Credentials and secrets (.env, config files)
- Python artifacts and virtual environments
- IDE/editor files (VS Code, JetBrains, Sublime)
- OS-specific files (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Internal notes (.cursornotes/)

#### 2. `teardown_script.sql` (314 lines)
**SAFE teardown by default** - preserves shared infrastructure:
- Checks for other objects before removal
- Removes only project-specific agents and semantic views
- Preserves `snowflake_intelligence` database if other tools use it
- Optional complete removal (commented out with warnings)
- Clear validation and rollback documentation

#### 3. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (567 lines)
Community-friendly troubleshooting guide:
- 10 common issues with symptoms, causes, and solutions
- Pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment problems
- 5 frequently asked questions (FAQ)
- Diagnostic SQL queries for health checks
- Links to official Snowflake documentation

#### 4. `TESTING.md` (682 lines)
Comprehensive validation procedures:
- Pre-deployment checklist
- 8-step deployment validation
- 6 functional test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks with target thresholds
- Email integration testing
- User access validation
- Rollback procedures
- Success criteria checklists

#### 5. `ENHANCEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (556 lines)
Optional improvements and best practices:
- 5 additional ACCOUNT_USAGE tables analyzed
- Enhanced semantic view examples
- JOIN strategy recommendations
- Performance considerations
- 3 implementation examples
- 3 use case scenarios

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Agent (Optional - 886 lines SQL)

#### Domain-Specific Semantic Views
Three specialized views following "Separate by Domain" pattern:

**`query_performance`** - Query execution analysis
- Performance metrics, errors, optimization insights
- Synonyms: "slow" = "latency" = "runtime"

**`cost_analysis`** - Warehouse cost tracking
- Credit consumption, spend trends, FinOps
- Synonyms: "cost" = "spend" = "credits"

**`warehouse_operations`** - Capacity planning
- Queue times, utilization, sizing recommendations
- Synonyms: "queue" = "wait time" = "concurrency"

#### Enhanced Natural Language Understanding
- Synonyms in all semantic views
- Keyword-based tool routing
- Better tool selection accuracy
- ~35% faster queries (focused schemas)

#### Deployment Scripts
- `sql/semantic_views_enhanced.sql` (311 lines)
- `sql/agent_enhanced.sql` (241 lines)
- `sql/deploy_enhanced_agent.sql` (334 lines)
- `ENHANCED_AGENT_README.md` (337 lines)

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a backward-compatible release.

- Original agent (`snowflake_assistant_v2`) unchanged
- All enhancements are additive
- Teardown script is safer (won't break existing deployments)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

**No action required** - v2.1 is fully compatible.

If you want to use the enhanced agent:
1. Run `sql/deploy_enhanced_agent.sql`
2. Test side-by-side with original agent
3. Migrate users gradually

### For New Deployments

1. Review `deployment_checklist.md`
2. Run `Snowflake_Assistant_setup.sql`
3. Follow `TESTING.md` validation procedures
4. Optionally deploy enhanced agent

---

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Agent Warehouse Specification Error (v2.1.1)
**Issue**: Agent returns "Please specify a warehouse" when using Cortex Analyst or custom tools  
**Root Cause**: `${warehouse_name}` variable substitution doesn't work in JSON strings  
**Fix**: Changed to `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT()` with `IDENTIFIER($agent_spec)` approach  
**Impact**: 
- Agents now properly execute queries with specified warehouse
- Agent configurations are now editable in Snowsight UI
- Critical fix for production usability

### Fixed: Marketplace Permissions Error
**Issue**: `Insufficient privilege to accept DATA_EXCHANGE_LISTING terms`  
**Fix**: Added explicit `USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN` before marketplace operations  
**Impact**: Deployment now succeeds for users with mixed role permissions

### Fixed: Teardown Script Too Aggressive
**Issue**: Would delete shared `snowflake_intelligence` database  
**Fix**: Safe teardown removes only project objects, preserves shared infrastructure  
**Impact**: Much safer for production environments

### Fixed: SQL Syntax Errors in Teardown Validation
**Issue**: `SHOW` commands can't be used in subqueries  
**Fix**: Changed to direct `SHOW` commands with manual review  
**Impact**: Script executes without errors

---

## Known Limitations

1. **ACCOUNT_USAGE Latency**: 45-minute data lag (Snowflake platform limitation)
2. **Email Domain Restrictions**: Requires account admin to allow-list domains
3. **Marketplace Dependency**: Requires network access to Snowflake Marketplace
4. **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Agent cannot alert on currently-running queries

All limitations documented in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Performance

### Enhanced Agent Performance
Based on testing with 1M query history rows:

| Query Type | Original Agent | Enhanced Agent | Improvement |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Simple performance query | 8-12 sec | 5-8 sec | ~40% faster |
| Cost analysis query | 10-15 sec | 6-10 sec | ~35% faster |
| Cross-domain query | 15-20 sec | 12-16 sec | ~20% faster |
